- [x] Set up AI client configuration with OpenRouter endpoint
- [x] Create teams database with popular sports teams
- [x] Set up utility functions

## Phase 2: Backend API Development
- [x] Implement prediction API endpoint (`/api/predict`)
- [x] Implement teams suggestion API endpoint (`/api/teams`)
- [x] Implement history API endpoint (`/api/history`)
- [x] Configure AI integration with specialized sports analysis prompt

## Phase 3: Frontend Components

## Phase 5: Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Phase 6: Build & Testing
- [ ] Install dependencies and build application
- [ ] API testing with curl commands (predict, teams, history endpoints)
- [ ] Test team input validation and autocomplete
- [ ] Test prediction generation and result display
- [ ] Test prediction history functionality

## Phase 7: Final Validation
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] Performance and error handling validation
- [ ] User experience testing

## Completed Steps
- [x] Project exploration and structure analysis
- [x] Comprehensive plan creation and approval
